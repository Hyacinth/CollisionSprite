### examples/cocos2d 1.x (no iPad retina)
* Uses cocos2d 1.x, so this project works for the iPhone, retina-enabled iPhone, and non-retina iPad; the new iPad retina display is not supported.
* HD images are included and displayed for the retina iPhone and non-retina iPad.
* PESprite will handle all cases automatically.

### examples/cocos2d 2.x (all supported)
* Uses cocos2d 2.x, so this project works for everything (non-retina and retina iPhone and iPad).
* The non-retina iPad will use the -hd images while the iPad retina will use the -ipadhd images.
* PESprite will handle all cases automatically.
